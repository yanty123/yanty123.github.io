I am a Ph.D. student at the [State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IOTSC), University of Macau](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), advised by [Prof. Jianbing Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_Q3NTToAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Chengzhong Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XsBBTUgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), working with [Prof. Jinqiao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7_BkyxEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Ming Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=woezF_MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and my B.Eng. degree from BUPT, working with [Prof. Chuan Shi](http://www.shichuan.org/). I have also gained industrial experience at Li Auto, Xiaomi EV as a research intern.

My research lies at the intersection of Generative World Models, End-to-End Autonomous Driving, and Embodied AI. Currently, my primary focus is on enabling agents to achieve infinite driving and self-play within physically reliable, imaginative world models.
