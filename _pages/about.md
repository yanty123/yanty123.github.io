I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jianbing Shen and Prof. Cheng-zhong Xu. My current research interests primarily focus on generative models, autonomous driving simulation, and AIGC (AI-Generated Content).

Previously, I received my Master's degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), under the supervision of Prof. Jinqiao Wang and Prof. Ming Tang. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Intelligent Science and Technology from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2020.

I am always open for research discussions and collaborations.
